The float data types are used to store positive and negative numbers with a decimal point, like 35.3, -2.34, or 3597.34987.

The float data type has two keywords:

Type	Size	Range
float32	32 bits	-3.4e+38 to 3.4e+38.
float64	64 bits	-1.7e+308 to +1.7e+308.

Go array 
- practise with interface

array indexes start at 0. That means that [0] is the first element, [1] is the second element, etc.

Access element: array[index]

Modify element: array[index] = newValue
I want to change 1993 to 200838

   numbers = append(numbers, 40)

    // Add multiple elements
    numbers = append(numbers, 50, 60, 70)

- Bye bye see you next array go
